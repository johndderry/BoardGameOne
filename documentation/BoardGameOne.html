<h1>Game Board One Help</h1><H2>Introduction</H2>
<P>BoardGameOne is a browser-based game engine for creating computer
games based on a grid of equally spaced squares. Games created with
it are styled after board games of old, but with additions borrowed
from role playing games and early two dimensional computer games like
Zelda. BoardGameOne has these basic features:</P>
<UL>
  <LI><P>Game Definition Editor</P>
  <LI><P>Game Player which can be easily modified to open a specific
  game when loaded into the browser</P>
  <LI><P>Basic set of images for buildings, landscapes, home
  furnishings, bodies of water, modes of transportation, players,
  obstacles, tools. This basic set can be expanded to include your own
  images.</P>
  <LI><P>Built-in scripting language, simple and easy to learn.</P>
  <LI><P>Time-slices for movement of players and obstacles.</P>
  <LI><P>Ability to chain to new game board, an then return to the
  previous board, all during game play.</P>
</UL>
<H2>Game Definition Editor</H2>
<P>The Game Definition Editor path is util/editor.html. 
</P>
<P>It is used to create and edit a game definition, and can also be
used to run the game and see how it is working. Game definitions are
stored as a single JSON map, which can be saved though a web server
with Http PUT ability, or save locally with a cut-and-paste
operation.</P>
<P>Besides the complete game definition, the editor includes a
scratch area where selected portions of the game definition can
written to, and then read from, in order to reuse elements of an
already created game into a new game. 
</P>
<P>The editor also has support for troubleshooting your game
functionality, with Single-Step run mode, and direct entry of Script
instructions. 
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Basic Description of Editor Page Functions by
Line</H3>
<P>After opening up the Game Editor in your browser, you will see:
two lines beginning with titles in bold, two blank colored
lines(red/blue), three more lines with titles in bold, and a section
in green. Basic functions are grouped together on each line. Here is
a basic description of the functionality of each group:</P>
<UL>
  <LI><P><B>File</B><br><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">loading and
  saving the game definition to the web server or local storage,
  loading or saving the scratch area to web/local storage, and

</UL>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal">As of yet, the game board hasn't
appeared on the page. It will appear directly above the red and blue
lines after loading one with the File-Load button or creating one

  <UL>
    <LI><P STYLE="font-weight: normal">Name<br>text area for the name
    of the JSON map file in which to load from, or save to, the game
    board definition. This applies to saving through the web server, but
    not when saving locally. This definition will cover the Board,
    Players, and Items definition data.</P>
    <LI><P STYLE="font-weight: normal">Load<br>button to load the named
    board definition file from the web server, or from the text box for
    local storage. When developing with Dart and using the supplied web
    server application, the location path is: BoardGame1/web/data; the
    extension is: .json. The function uses a Http GET on port 8080.
    Loading a board definition will overwrite the current game board, if
    it is present.</P>
    <LI><P STYLE="font-weight: normal">Save<br>button to save the named
    board definition file to the web server, or write in to the text box
    for local storage. The location and extension, when using Dart with
    the supplied web server application, is the same as a load. The
    function uses a Http PUT on port 8080. The board definition is a
    complete description of the current game Board, with Players and
    Items included 
    </P>
    <LI><P>UseLocal<br>button to select loading and saving to a local
    file using cut-and-paste operations, for both board definition and
    scratch area, instead of a web server. This button will open a small
    text window in which text can be displayed. For loading, this is the
    text box will have the loading text pasted into it. For saving, this
    text box will show the text which will be cut out for pasting into a
    text editor.</P>
    <LI><P>UseWeb<br>button to select loading and saving with a web
    server. This will close the text box opened with UseLocal if
    present, and restore the default operation of loading and saving to
    a web server.</P>
    <LI><P>LoadScratch<br>button to load the named file into the
    Scratch Area. Just like the Load function, but the Scratch Area is
    loaded instead of the board definition.</P>
    <LI><P>SaveScratch<br>button to save the Scratch Area into the
    named file. Just like the Save function, but the Scratch Area is the
    source instead of the board definition.</P>
    <LI><P>ClearScratch<br>clear the Scratch Area of any contents. The
    Scratch Area is where selected portions of the game board, selected
    Players and selected Items can be written to or read from. It is
    used primarily for transferring portions of a game board definition
    from an existing board to a new board, basically a cut-and-paste
    area for definition data.</P>

<H2 CLASS="western">Common and Useful Properties of Game Elements</H2>
<P>Properties, along with the corresponding values associated with
them, are used extensively to control various aspects of the game
board and game play. These are generally referred to as
property-value pairs. All elements of BoardGameOne can have
property-value pairs attached to them. Some properties have been
predefined to be used in specific ways, that is to perform specific
functions in the game engine. Otherwise, properties can be created as
needed and accessed by the scripting language to perform other
functions which you define.

all elements and those that apply to a specific game element, and a

<h2>Action Scripting</h2>
Mandy is the scripting language used in Board Game One. Mandy style instructions go in
the various action properties ( action, enteraction, leaveaction ) and these instructions
are carried out at the appropriate time.
<h3>general help</h3>
Mandy is a very simple but powerful object-oriented scripting language.<br><br>
The first thing that is encountered from the script input is considered to be 
the name of an object to invoke. Following that are possible instructions 
to that object, which generally take the form of a simple name, list of names 
separated by commas, a quoted string, an expression in parenthesis; or  
an equals, plus or minus sign followed by quoted or unquoted text. A few objects
take multiple names for their instructions, like the object DUP.<br><br>
There are a small number of predefined objects, and some of those
are able to create additional objects. An object found in the script input with it's 
instructions invokes the Input method of the object. Otherwise, when an object name
is used as the instruction of another object, in a quoted string, or in an expression
it will considered a reference to that object, and will be prefaced with a dollar sign
and will invoke either the Output or Value method. Basically that's all there is to it.<br><br>
Two other things to start: "list 0" will give you a list of all predefined objects;
and an object name followed with a question mark will show help for that object.
<h3>quoting help</h3>
Whenever text is entered as an instruction to an object, it may be quoted 
in order to make it into a string of characters, which could then include 
spaces and tab characters which would normally end the instruction text.
In addition to that, use of quoting controls whether object references
(which are the name of the object prefaced by the dollar sign) are to be
expanded by the Output method to represent their contents or not.
The basic rule is:<ul>
<li>text without any quoting undergoes expansion of the object</li>
<li>text quoted with single quotes (') DOES NOT undergo expansion</li> 
<li>text quoted with double quotes (\") DOES undergo expansion</li></ul>
<h3>naming help</h3>
The names of new objects that you create can be simple or they can refer
to a heirarchy of objects that you create. The first rule of naming is that
names can contain characters, numbers, and most punctuation characters that
are not already reserved for object instruction.
Characters reserved for instruction are: \$  ?  !  =  -  + ' "<br>
To create heirarchy when naming objects, use the foward-slash (/)
to indicate increasing depth of heirarchy. Example:
 foo/bar indicates bar is subordinate to foo, and
 foo/bar/zoo indicates bar is subordinate to foo, and zoo subordinate to bar.
<h3>expression help</h3>
Expressions are entered in their natural form using parenthesis to indicate
grouping. Operators allowed in expressions are:
 +  -  *  /  ^  <  >  =  <>  or  and  not
<h3>methods help</h3>
Methods are a means of accessing properties and stored routines of an
object. They are tailored to meet the needs of each object.
You create your own methods when you use Object to read a prototype
and that prototype contains routines.
There are also automatic methods available to access the value and text
properties of any object which has them. That includes ones which you create
with Object as well as the GUI objects, which keep GUI configuration in
properties.n\
To indicate a method, append the method name to the object with a period.
This works when invoking the object for input at the beginning of the line,
or using it with expansion by prefacing it with the dollar sign '\$'.
See help on "quoting".
<h2>Standard Objects</h2>
These are the basic objects in the script language.
<h3>accept</h3>
<p><i>accept</i> text_object<br>text_object = <i>&#36;accept</i></p>
The Accept object is used to accept a line of input characters from the player.
It is generally invoking inside of a routine and the result is assigned to
a Text object. This basic form is "accept textobject".<br>
However, in an assignment to a text object, it's refered to as \$accept.
This assignment form is "textobject = \$accept". In either case, 
the accept object will cause Mandy to wait for a line of text input from the console
and then assign it to the text object.
<h3>echo</h3>
<p><i>echo</i> object</p>
The Echo object is used to display text and values to the player.
It will echo to the console the next object on the input line, substituting any
object references for the contents of the object. Object references
are the name of the object preceded by the dollar sign (\$).
Text can be quoted with single (') or double (") quotes.
See help on 'quoting' for more information on quoting in Mandy.
<h3>help</h3>
<p><i>help</i> object_name[,object_name,...]</p>
The Help object will offer help on the list of subjects which follow.
Subjects can be object names, like 'help', or an additional topic if available.
Help offerered for objects using the "help objectname" form is the exact same help 
supplied by using ? with the object itself "objectname ?".<br><br>
Besides objects, Help offers help on these topics: 
general, quoting, naming, expressions and methods.
<h3>list</h3>
<p><i>list</i> level_number</p>
The list object will provide a list of objects in the dictionarie(s).
Used alone it will show objects from all dictionary levels. Levels
increase when Routine-created objects are called with the Call object.
When a numeric expression is provided, only dictionaries from that level
or greater are shown. Level 0 contains all predefined language objects,
and level 1 and greater contain all created objects.<br><br> When the game engine
is running, level 1 contains global game objects, and if any action scripts
are in effect level 2 contains objects created in that script.
<h3>call</h3>
<p><i>call</i> text_object</p>
The Call object is used to invoke a stored routine.
Following the Call object should be the name of an object
which has been previously created with the Routine object.
<h3>verbose</h3>
<p><i>verbose</i> number</p>
The Verbose object is used to control the level of verbosity, which is
the level information that Mandy provides as it interprets instructions.
The Verbose object acts just like a object created by Value and takes
the same methods: =, + and -.<br>
The value of verbosity can be numeric from 0 to 4.
<h3>break</h3>
<p><i>break</i> instructions</p>
The Break object is used to interupt interpretation of the current stream
and enter an interactive Mandy state. Whatever follows on the input line
is passed to the interpreter and interpeted before any other input.
To return to the previous interupted state use the End object.
<h3>compare</h3>
  <p><i>compare</i> object_1 object_2</p>
  The compare object will compare two objects and return the relationship as a value.
  When the two objects are text objects, compare will perform alphabetic sorting. 
  Compare is first used with the two objects supplied on the input line as arguments.
  Then compare is referenced in an exression or in a value object assignment. The value 
  of compare will be -1, 0, or 1 depending on whether the first object is alphabetically 
  less than, the same as, or greater than the second object.
<h3>textobj</h3>
An object created with the Text object can store and manipulate text.
These methods are available for text objects:<br>
= text_to_assign<br>
+ text_to_append<br>
The text_to_assign or text_to_append can be quoted with single (') or double(")
quotes, and substitution for object references are expanded for both = and +.
See help on 'quoting' for more information on quoting.<br>
<h3>valueobj</h3>
An object created with the Value object can store and manipulate values.
These methods are available for value objects:<br>
= value_expression_to_assign<br>
+ value_expression_to_add<br>
- value_expression_to_subtract<br>
value_expression_... are expressions encased in parenthesis. 
See help on 'expressions' for more information on expressions.
<h3>objectobj</h3>
An object created with the Object object can act like any other
objects in Mandy. They will be recognized as an object on the input line
both at the beginning as an object, or as a text reference with \$object_name.
Recognized on the input line it can be used to expand it's prototype.
As text reference it will list all methods and properties it contains.
Additional methods can be accessed with '.method' notation.
See additional help on 'methods'.
<h3>text</h3>
<p><i>text</i> object_name[,object_name,...]</p>
The Text object is used to create new objects which can hold either text
or routines (routines are a set Mandy instructions which are
invoked later). Following the Text object should be the name, or a list of names,
which the new object(s) will take.
See help on 'naming' for more information on object naming in Mandy.
<h3>value</h3>
<p><i>value</i> object_name[,object_name,...]</p>
The Value object is used to create new objects which can hold values.
Following the Value object should be the name, or a list of names,
which the new object(s) will take.
See help on 'naming' for more information on object naming in Mandy.
<h3>object</h3>
<p><i>object</i> object_name[,object_name,...]</p>
The Object object is used to create new general purpose objects. These objects
will be derived from user-supplied prototypes. Following the Object object 
should be the name, or a list of names, which the new object(s) will take.
<h3>dup</h3>
<p><i>dup</i> new_object_name object_name</p>
The dup object is used to duplicate an existing object, making an exact copy 
with a new name. Text and Value objects will retain their original data,
and for Object objects all properties and methods are duplicated into the new object.
The dup object is unusual in that it takes two instructions: following the dup object 
should be the name of the object to duplicate, and following that is the name 
that the new object will take.
<h3>end</h3>
<p><i>end</i></p>
The End object is used to end a block of instructions which
have been started by the use of a For, While, or If object.
It can be also used to end the Mandy interpreter itself.
<h3>else</h3>
<p><i>else</i></p>
The Else object is used to end the block of conditional instructions executed 
when true, and begin the block of conditional instructions executed when false.
<h3>if</h3>
<p><i>if</i> condition</p>
The If object is used to conditionally execute a set of instructions.
Following the If object is an expression which will be evaluated for truth.
If true, all the input lines following the If object will be executed until
either an Else or End object is encountered. If false, all the input lines
will be ignored until an Else object is encountered, and the lines following
the Else until an End object will be executed. If no Else is encountered,
all lines will be ignored until the End.
<h3>while</h3>
<p><i>while</i> condition</p>
The While object is used to repeatedly execute a set of instructions
while a certain condition is true. The condition is evaluated before
each execution of the set, and when events occuring within the instructions
change the condition in then that will be reflected in the evaluation
and the loop can end.<br>
Immediately following the While object is an expression which will be
evaluated for truth. If true, all instructions on the lines following will
be executed, until an End object is encountered. At that point, the
expression will be re-evaluated and if still true, the instructions
will be executed again. This will continue until the condition
is finally evaluated false.
<h2>Game Objects</h2>
These are script objects which are associated with game board and
are only available while the game is in run mode.
<h3>player</h3>
<p><i>player</i> new_object_name player_identifier</p>
Player is used to create an object with the modifiable properties of an active player.
The first argument is the name of the object to create, and the second the identifier of the
player whose properties you wish to access, or "POV". Reading the value of the Player object
will return the success of the last usage of Player.
<h3>square</h3>
<p><i>square</i> new_object_name square_identifier<br>
value_object = <i>&#36;square</i><br>
text_object = <i>&#36;square</i></p>
Square is used to create an object with the modifiable properties of a board square.
The first argument is the name of the object to create, and the second the identifier of the
square whose properties you wish to access. Reading the value of the Square object will
return the success of the last Square usage. Reading the output of the Square object will
return the name of the resident, if any, occupying the square or else will return 'none'.
<h3>warp</h3>
<p><i>warp</i> player_identifier location_identifier</p>
Warp is used to instantly transport a player to a specific location on the board
