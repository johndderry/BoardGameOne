# BoardGameOne
First version of a dart-language based game engine, called Board Game One of all things.

You need to start up the resource server with ./runserver.sh, then you can point Dartium
to one of RoadChicken.html or MDG.html. Also see the html files in web/util for 
other files such as the editor and (game) player.
